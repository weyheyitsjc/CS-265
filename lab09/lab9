Lab 9 answer sheet

Q1.1) A file "core" was created after bug3 was compiled.

Q1.2) It was bombed in the inTable() function.

Q1.3)
    c) In the main function's while loop, the numLines was incremented before it was used. It caused numLines be out of range of the array size. I fixed it by moving the increment of 
        numLines to the end of the while loop after it was used in st[ numLines ] = strdup( buff ).
    e) The T_MINUS case was subtracting the second element of the stack from the first element of the stack (element 1 - element 2), subtracting by LIFO. I fixed it so the second element 
        of the stack subtracted the first element of the stack (element 2 - element 1), subtracting by FIFO.
    f) The problem is that the quicksort only sorted the left side of the pivot. You would put swap(v,0,rand() % n); to change the pivot point to v[0] (the first position). You need assert 
        ((last >= 0) && (last < n)); to check if it was implemented properly.

Q1.4) The compiler can only catch syntax errors not logic errors. To the compiler, it is correct, but it isn't.

Q1.5) It would be a error because qsort only accepts pointers to object being sorted (char) and strcmp accepts simple pointers to char.
