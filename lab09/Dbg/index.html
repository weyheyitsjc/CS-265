<h1> Lab &mdash; Debugging </h1>

<p> Questions will be denoted with a <span class='question'>Q</span>. </p>

<ul>
	<li> Make some appropriate subdirectory for this lab and go there </li>
	<li> Copy ~kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Labs/Dbg to your lab directory </li>
</ul>

<p>See a short (and still incomplete) <a target='265ref'
	href='http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~kschmidt/Ref/gdb_reference.html'>GDB quick
	reference</a></p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Make sure core files will be written (for Bash only):
		<div class='cli'>
			ulimit -c unlimited
		</div>
	 </li>
	<li> Compile <span class='fn'>bug3.cc</span> (without debug information) </li>
		<div class='cli'>gcc -o bug3 bug3.c</div>
	 </li>
	<li> Run it w/this input file:
		<div class='cli'>./bug3 in.bug3</div>
	</li>
	<li> It will ask you for a string to search.  Give it one (doesn't matter if it exists in the table) </li>
</ul>

<script><!--
	q = "What happened when you ran <span class='fn'>bug3</span>?  Use <span class='cmd'>ls -ot</span>, \
			see if there are any new files in your directory."
	question( q )
	//--></script>


<h2> Loading corefile into GDB </h2>

<p> Even if you didn't compile w/the extra debug info, and you <i>don't</i> read the instructions for the given chipset,
	the debugger can still be useful.  For example, we can use backtrace (bt) to look at the runtime stack, see in which
	function we were when we dumped: </p>

	<ul>
		<li> Look in the directory, find a file called <span class='fn'>core</span>, or maybe
			<span class='fn'>core.<i>nnnn</i></span> </li>
		<li> Load the binary and the corefile into the debugger: </li>
			<div class='cli'>$ gdb bug3 -c <i>core</i></div>
		<li> Use GDB's <span class='cmd'>backtrace</span> command to see the stack: </li>
			<div class='cli'>(gdb) bt</div>
		<li> This give you a list of calls, on the stack.  The most recent is
			on the top. </li>
		<li> Don't leave corefiles lyin' around.  They can get pretty large
			(look at them). </li>
	</ul>

<script><!--
	question( "In which function did it bomb?" )
	//--></script>

	<h3> Setup </h3>

	<p> To run programs in a debugger (and see stuff that looks familiar to you) you must compile all files w/the
	<span class='cmd'>-g</span class='cmd'> flag. </p>

<h2> Running programs inside GDB </h2>

	<script><!--
		question( "Okay, now, use GDB to debug these other programs." )
		//--></script>

	<p> For each, below, record what the problem was, and how you fixed it. </p>

<ol type='a'>
	<li>  <strike><span class='fn'>bug1.c</span> - common bug in C.</strike> <font color='red'>OBE by compiler</font>  </li>
	<li>  <strike><span class='fn'>bug2.c</span> - common bug in C.</strike> <font color='red'>OBE by compiler</font>  </li>
	<li>  <span class='fn'>bug3.c</span> &ndash; when tested with <span class='fn'>in.bug3</b></tt>
		as input  </li>
	<li>  <strike><span class='fn'>avg.c</span> - example use of assert.</strike> <font color='red'>Not this
			term.</font>
	</li>
	<li>  Look at the program in <span class='fn'>Labs/Dbg/Calc</span>, a postfix calculator ( <span
		class='cmd'>=</span> commands the calculator to print the value on the top of the stack ) which reads <span
		class='fn'>stdin</span> .

		<p> To compile: </p>

		<div class='cli'>gcc -g *.c</div>

		<p> There are some sample expressions in <span class='fn'>input</span>.  Verify that the calculator works correctly
			on all.  (It does not.)  Load it into the debugger, devise some simple input that makes it misbehave, and try to
			diagnose the problem. </p>
	 </li>

	<li> A program that causes a segmentation violation: 
		<p> <span class='fn'>driverBug.c</span> compiled with
		<span class='fn'>quicksortBug.c</span>. </p>
	</li>

	<p> simple bug in the quicksort program from the text &ndash; how would you find it?  What assertions could you put
		into the code to check that the algorithm was implemented properly? </p>

	<p>To generate the error run <span class='fn'>driverBug</span> with the input <span class='fn'>in</span> </p>
</ol>

<p> <span class='fn'>sort2.c</span> uses qsort to sort an array of strings.  The error comes from passing qsort a
	function to compare integers rather than strings. </p>
	
	<script><!--
		q = "Why can't the compiler catch this?  You can uncover the problem by looking at a stack trace \
				from when the program crashed (see the lab on how to do this). "
		question( q )
	//--></script>

	<script><!--
		q = "What happens if you are using qsort to sort integers and accidently pass the string comparison function?"
		question( q )
	//--></script>
