Q1. The output is a list of all the files in my course directory that was modified 2 days ago.

Q2. find . -type f -name *.bash

Q3. It returns the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

Q4. ls -1 | wc -l

Q5. grep "bread" breadIsDangerous.txt 

Q6. grep "the" breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l 

Q7. It created another file (back up) of the original file that had the mispelled words from before it was fixed.

Q8. It displays the lines that are different between the two files. The first file's line (the one typed first in the command) is before the other file's
line (e.g. 3c3). The actual line in the file that is different is displayed below. It shows the line with the change in spelling (line 3) and the line
that I just added to spellExample.

Q9. Nothing happened because I am checking the difference between the same file. 

Q10. No, it wasn't the output I expected. Instead of sorting the numbers in order (numerically), the command sorted all the numbers by their first digits
and put it in order from smallest to largest.

Q11 & 12. Yes, the output was different because of -n, the numbers were sorted as a whole number rather than the first digit and from smallest to largest.

Q13. The files are sorting the 4th column (-k4) and then put in order from smallest to largest. Then -r (reverse) listed in order from largest to
smallest file size. 

Q14. du * -a | sort -n -r | head -n 8 

Q15. For "grep dough breadIsDangerous.txt" it returned the line with dough in it and "echo $?" returns 0 since the command was a successful. The second
command "grep uniqueString breadIsDangerous.txt" didn't return any lines since "uniqueString" doesn't exist in the file and "echo $?" returned 1 because the
file exists but "uniqueString" doesn't so there was 1 error from the command.  The third command "grep dough noSuchFile" states that the file doesn't exist
and "echo$?" returned 2 because the file didn't exist so there was 2 errors in the command.
