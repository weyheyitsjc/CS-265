Lab 3 answer sheet

Q1. The output is true because bash took the comparison part as a string rather than a test.

Q2. The string "All we have to decide is what to do with the chocolate that is given to us..." is displayed because "&>/dev/null" is sending the grep command
to another file and displays the line whenever it found "chocolate".

Q3. The output was 2 since bash can't do floating point arithmetic natively so it rounded the answer down to 2.

Q4. The output was 0 since the last command had no errors when it was executed.

Q5. The first command displayed "5 12 13" and the second displayed "5 13". The first command was a command sequence and assigned x as 12 so it executed the
$x. The second command didn't have anything assigned to x so it just displayed "5 13".

Q6. It displayed all the words separated n the file "blah" ("Item\n Another\n Item") since the for loop is taking in the read file and echoing every single
member (item) in the file. 

Q7. It shows the two lines in the file, "Item" and "Another item" ("Item\n Another item") since the while loop iterates by lines in a file.

Q8. It produced the same output as Q7 ("Item\n Another item").
